# slot_machine_game
a simple python game i made for practice. I used it to help me learn more about functions and classes in python, and also used it to learn more about various libraries that i can use with python. I am most proud of the JSON serialization and deserialization which I implemented, which is used to track highscores of players and store it in a player_data file.
* to play the game, download the file, run it in your terminal and follow the instructions on screen
